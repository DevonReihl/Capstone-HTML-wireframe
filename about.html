        The Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen 
        (GISHWHES, pronounced gish-wes)[1] (recently shortened to just "GISH") is an 
        annual week-long competitive media scavenger hunt originally held each October or 
        November, but more recently each August. Teams of 15 competitors earn points for 
        submitting photos and videos of themselves completing prompts from a list they receive 
        at the beginning of the week. Actor Misha Collins officially founded GISHWHES in 2011 
        after a publicity stunt to help the television series Supernatural 
        (on which Collins appears) win a People's Choice Award. The competition holds 
        a world record for being the largest media scavenger hunt ever to take place, and 
        several additional world records. Thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GISHWHES">Wikipedia</a></p>
